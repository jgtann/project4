# project4
was a Capstone Project for General Assembly Data Science course (Oct-Dec 2022).  
The dataset (red wine quality) was downloaded from
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/red-wine-quality-cortez-et-al-2009

The objective for this project is to build a prediction model (classification), and deploy as web app
for the prediction of 'good' or 'bad' red wine.  The web app is designed to be interactive, whereby user
can input the value of 11 features (e.g. pH, density, sulphates, citric acidity...), click on predict button,
and a 'Good' or 'Bad' message will pop up as a result of the prediction. 

Open the Project4.ipynb for the python file that builds the ML classification model.

Using the streamlit framework, the prototype app is also set for deployment. Simply download the streamlit2.py file, ensure that streamlit library is available in your computer, open command prompt, type streamlit run streamlit2.py.  And voilah! Here's the ML web app! Enjoy!

The red wine quality prediction app is also available in the streamlit cloud, as per below:
